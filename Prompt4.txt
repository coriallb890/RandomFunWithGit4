After a long day of work, all I want to do is go home and sleep. But when I finally get home, I can't fall asleep. 
I toss and turn for hours, trying to get comfortable, but it's just not happening. 
I start to feel really frustrated and angry. I get out of bed and pace around my apartment, trying to tire myself out. But nothing seems to work. 
I feel like I'm going crazy. I lay back down in bed and close my eyes, willing myself to fall asleep. 
And finally, after what feels like forever, I do.
HELLO
